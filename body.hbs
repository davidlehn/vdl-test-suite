The purpose of this test suite is to demonstrate a path to interoperability
between the ISO-18013-5 Mobile Driver's License data model and the W3C
Verifiable Credentials ecosystem. The technologies explored in this test suite
are  experimental and meant to be complementary to ISO-18013-5 (mDL) and not a
replacement of the standard. This document contains the most recent
interoperability report between issuers and verifiers for Verifiable Driver's
License Credentials using the <a
href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vdl-vocab">Verifiable Driver's License
Vocabulary</a>. This report is generated on a weekly basis.

  <p>
The test matrices are generated by sending the payload in each example (without
the `proof` value) to an issuer. The digitally signed result of the issued
credential is then sent to a verifier. To generate the interoperability matrix,
all issuers are tested against all verifiers. At present, all issuers and
verifiers use the Ed25519 2018 cryptosuite.
  </p>

  <p>
In order to demonstrate some of the compression features of CBOR-LD QR Codes,
the Ed25519 2020 cryptosuite is used. The QR Code contains a base-32
alphanumeric encoded CBOR-LD payload that is digitally signed using the Ed25519
2020 cryptosuite, which allows for better compression when used with CBOR-LD.
The digital  signatures displayed in this report, and the ones used with issuers
and verifiers are different at present. The digital signatures used with issuers
and verifiers will be updated to the digital signatures described in this report
when support for the newer 2020 Ed25519 cryptosuite is supported by all issuers
and verifiers. Readers should take note that the interoperability demonstrated
in the matrices are for the 2018 Ed25519 cryptosuite, and not the 2020 Ed25519
cryptosuite.

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
The purpose of this document is to demonstrate that there are multiple Issuers
and Verifiers capable of processing Verifiable Driver's License Credentials that
conform to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vdl-vocab">Verifiable
Driver's License Vocabulary</a>.

    <h3> Testing Methodology</h3>
    <p>
The testing framework for the Verifiable Driver's License Vocab executes the
following process:
    </p>
    <ol class="algorithm">
      <li>
Reads a Verifiable Driver's License from the <code>credentials/</code>
directory.
      </li>
      <li>
Requests each Issuer under test to digitally sign the credential.
      </li>
      <li>
Checks the Verifiable Credential output of the issuance process for correctness.
      </li>
      <li>
Requests each Verifier under test to verify each Verifiable Driver's License
that is issued.
      </li>
      <li>
Collates the results in an interoperability matrix.
      </li>
    </ol>
